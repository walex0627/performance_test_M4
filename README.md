# Financial Data Management System for Fintech Transactions

## üìå Description
This project was developed for **ExpertSoft**, a Colombian software company specialized in solutions for the electrical sector.  
The client faced difficulties managing financial information from Fintech platforms such as **Nequi** and **Daviplata**, as the data was scattered across multiple disorganized Excel files (.xlsx).  

The implemented solution organizes, structures, and stores this information in a **SQL relational database**, enabling **bulk data loading**, complete **CRUD operations**, and **advanced queries** to meet business requirements.  
A minimal **frontend dashboard** allows basic management of one of the database entities.
